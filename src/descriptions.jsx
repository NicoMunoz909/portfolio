        I started making this app for a greengrocers shop I used to work in, the goal of the app is to make
        the process of taking home delivery orders smother.
      </p>
      <p>
        As of now the clients sends their order on WhatsApp and the order is then write down on an invoice but
        the poorly formated messages and omition of important information for the delivery by part of the
        clients makes this process very slow and frustrating.
      </p>
      <p>
        This app aims to make this process easier by completing the buying process sending a correctly
        formatted WhatsApp message to the store with all the information previously provided by the user on
        the app.

      A simple budget planner app. I had to make this one for a coding bootcamp. In the home page it shows the
      last 10 moves and the total account balance. On a second page it shows all the moves, it also lets the
      user create, modify or delete existing moves and filter them by expense or income. It also lets the user
      create custom categories to further organize his or her budget. Although inicially this was only done
      for the bootcamp, I found a budget planner comes in handy and I have a lot of idea for features to add
      in this one. So it offers a lot of potential for me to create a more complex app and keep learning while
      doing it.

      This is an app I made for my own use while working as a waiter to keep track of how much money I was
      making and more importantly how much I had to cash in or pay on Mondays, as we got paid our credit card
      tips every monday but got deducted 5% of our weekly sales from that amount. It lets the user record
      every table with its date, table name, amount, tip amount and wether the tip was in cash of credit card.
      And it shows how much the user has sold, the amount of tips in cash and in credit card, and the result
      of deducting 5% of the amount sold from the total of credit card tips. It also lets the user choose to
      see the tables by day or by week from monday to sunday.

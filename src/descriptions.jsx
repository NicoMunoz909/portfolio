        I started making this app for a greengrocers shop I used to work in, the
        goal of the app is to make the process of taking home delivery orders
        smother.
      </p>
      <p>
        As of now the clients sends their order on WhatsApp and the order is
        then write down on an invoice but the poorly formated messages and
        omition of important information for the delivery by part of the clients
        makes this process very slow and frustrating.
      </p>
      <p>
        This app aims to make this process easier by completing the buying
        process sending a correctly formatted WhatsApp message to the store with
        all the information previously provided by the user on the app.

    <p>
      A simple budget planner app. I had to make this one for a coding bootcamp.
      In the home page it shows the last 10 moves and the total account balance.
      On a second page it shows all the moves, it also lets the user create,
      modify or delete existing moves and filter them by expense or income. It
      also lets the user create custom categories to further organize his or her
      budget. Although inicially this was only done for the bootcamp, I found a
      budget planner comes in handy and I have a lot of idea for features to add
      in this one. So it offers a lot of potential for me to create a more
      complex app and keep learning while doing it.

        A full-featured inventory tracking system designed to streamline the
        management of hardware assets in a business environment. This
        application allows users to register equipment entries with detailed
        information such as purchase order, supplier, serial numbers, and
        storage sector. It also tracks the lifecycle of each item, including
        sales data, destination, and key timestamps like entry and exit dates.
        The system includes tagging for backup and demo units to maintain
        clarity on hardware usage and availability. With a clean and intuitive
        interface, the app provides quick access to crucial data and supports
        efficient record-keeping and retrieval. Built using Node.js, Express,
        Sequelize, and MySQL, the backend handles data validation and storage,
        while the frontend ensures responsive interaction and clear
        visualization of the inventory status.
